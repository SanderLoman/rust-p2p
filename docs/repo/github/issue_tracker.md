# Issue Tracker

Our project utilizes GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/nodura/projects/1) to efficiently track and manage issues, tasks, and progress. This system provides a visual overview of the project status and ensures that everything is organized and easily accessible.

## Key Views

### 1. Overview

The Overview tab provides a general summary of all issues and their current status. This is the default view where you can get a quick snapshot of the project's overall progress.

### 2. Good First Issues

This view is specifically for issues that are deemed suitable for newcomers. These issues are usually simpler and well-documented, making them ideal for those who are just starting to contribute to the project.

### 3. Triage

The Triage view is used for sorting and categorizing new issues. Here, issues are reviewed, labeled, and assigned to the appropriate team members or people that want to pick up the issue. This step ensures that all new issues are properly managed and do not fall through the cracks.

### 4. Assigned Issues

This view shows all the issues that have been assigned to the person currently viewing the project. It uses the filter `assignee:@me` to display only the issues assigned to the logged-in user. This helps in tracking personal assignments and ensures accountability and progress tracking.

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Improve this more -->

### 5. Custom Views

Users can customize table views to suit their preferences. Which only they can see.

## Integration with Issues

All issues created in the repository are automatically linked to the Issue Tracker. This integration ensures seamless tracking and management of issues within the larger project context. To create an issue and have it appear in the tracker:

1. Navigate to the [Issues page](https://github.com/nodura/contower/issues).
2. Click on the "New issue" button and follow the steps outlined in the [Issues in Our Project](issues.md) guide.

## Managing and Updating Issues

Once issues are in the tracker, you can:

<!-- -   Move issues between columns to indicate progress (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress") in your own "Assigned Issues" view.
-   Add comments or updates directly within the Issue Tracker. -->

This dynamic system ensures that all team members are on the same page and can easily see what needs to be done and what is currently being worked on.

By utilizing the Issue Tracker effectively, we can ensure that our project remains organized, tasks are completed on time, and all contributors are aligned with the project's goals and progress.
