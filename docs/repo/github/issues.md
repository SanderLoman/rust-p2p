# Issues in Our Project

In our project [issues](https://github.com/nodura/contower/issues) are used as a primary method to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other types of work. They help maintain organization and facilitate effective collaboration among team members. Here is how we categorize and handle different kinds of issues.

## Types of Issues

There are several types of issues that you might encounter or create in our project:

### 1. Bug

A bug is an error, flaw, failure, or fault in the software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Bugs need to be addressed to improve the stability and performance of the software.

### 2. Documentation

Documentation issues arise when there are inaccuracies, insufficient details, or enhancements needed in the written documentation about the project. This could include README files, inline code comments, and external guides or tutorials.

### 3. Feature Request

Feature requests are ideas or proposals for new features to be added to the software. These issues allow users and contributors to suggest improvements or new functionality that they believe will enhance the software.

## Creating an Issue

To create an issue, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Issues page](https://github.com/nodura/contower/issues) of the repository.
2. Click on the "New issue" button.
3. Select the appropriate issue template.
4. Fill in the issue form, providing as much detail as possible.
5. If necessary, add more labels to better fit the issue.
6. Submit the issue by clicking the "Submit new issue" button.

The issues will automatically be assigned certain labels based on the selected template.

## Managing Issues

If you encounter an issue you are interested in working on, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the issue page.
2. Leave a comment on the issue stating your interest in working on it and requesting to be assigned.
3. An admin or organization member will then assign the issue to you.

This process helps maintain organized and controlled management of issues, ensuring that work is not duplicated and that contributors are aware of who is working on what.

## Integration with [Issue Tracker](issue_tracker.md) (Projects)

When an issue is created, it is automatically added to our repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/nodura/projects/1). This helps in tracking the progress of each issue within the larger context of the project development timeline. To view and manage these issues within the tracker, navigate to the [Projects](https://github.com/nodura/contower/projects?query=is%3Aopen) tab in our repository.

## Handling Stale Issues and Pull Requests

Our project uses a GitHub Action [stale.yml](https://github.com/nodura/contower/blob/stable/.github/workflows/stale.yml) to manage stale issues and pull requests to ensure the repository stays up-to-date. Any issue or pull request that has not been active for 30 days is marked as stale. If there is no further activity within the next 7 days, it is automatically closed. This helps to focus on items that are currently relevant and in need of attention.

Exemptions to this rule include issues and pull requests with any assignees, or labeled with https://github.com/nodura/contower/labels/P-Prevent-Stale. These items are considered important and are exempt from automatic closure based on inactivity.

## Fixing an Issue

After you have fixed an issue, you should create a pull request to submit your changes for review. For detailed instructions on how to create a pull request, please refer to our [Pull Request](./pull_requests) documentation.

By following these steps and guidelines, we can ensure that our project remains well-organized and that collaboration among team members is efficient and productive.
