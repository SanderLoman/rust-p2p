# Project Label Guide

This document provides an overview of the labeling system used in our project. Labels help us manage workflow and communicate the state of issues and pull requests effectively.

## Label Categories

### Functional Area Labels ([`FA-`][FA])

These labels denote the specific area of the project an issue or pull request affects, helping to sort and prioritize work more effectively.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/FA-CLI - Issues related to the Command Line Interface.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/FA-DB - Issues related to the database.

### Category Labels ([`C-`][C])

Category labels specify the type of issue or change being proposed or reported. They help in quickly identifying the nature of the issues or enhancements.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/C-Bug - An unexpected or incorrect behavior.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/C-Enhancement - New features or requests.

### Process Labels ([`P-`][P])

Process labels convey special information to maintainers and contributors about the status or required actions for issues and pull requests.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/P-Needs-Review - Pull requests that require code review.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/P-Prevent-Stale - Prevents old inactive issues/PRs from being closed due to inactivity.

### Compatibility Labels ([`COMP-`][COMP])

These labels indicate the compatibility or specific environments that an issue or pull request relates to, such as operating systems or external platforms.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/COMP-Linux - Linux specific issues.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/COMP-Docker - Docker specific issues.

### Urgency Labels ([`U-`][U])

Urgency labels help prioritize issues based on the immediacy of their impact on the project or the users.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/U-Critical - Must be fixed immediately to prevent severe impact.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/U-High - Requires immediate attention.

### Lifecycle Status Labels ([`LS-`][LS])

These labels indicate the current status of an issue or pull request, providing quick visibility into progress and process flow.

**Examples:**

-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/LS-Blocked - Cannot move forward until changes occur.
-   https://github.com/Nodura/Contower/labels/LS-Needs-Triage - Needs to be assessed and categorized.

## Labeling Guidelines

-   **Consistency**: Use labels consistently across issues and pull requests to maintain clarity and predictability.
-   **Specificity**: Choose the most appropriate label that accurately reflects the nature of the issue or PR.
-   **Relevance**: Avoid using unnecessary labels that do not add value or provide meaningful information.
-   **Combination**: Combine labels from different categories to provide a comprehensive overview of the issue or PR.
-   **Updates**: Regularly update labels to reflect changes in status, priority, or scope as the issue or PR progresses.

## Using Labels

Labels should be applied as soon as an issue is created or a pull request is opened. Multiple labels from different categories can be applied to a single issue or PR to provide a comprehensive overview at a glance. Contributors are encouraged to add or update labels during the lifecycle of the issue or PR to reflect changes in status or scope.
