# Architecture documentation

_This folder contains documentation about the architecture of the execution, consensus, and relay mechanisms._

The architecture documentation is divided into the following sections:

-   [**Execution**](./execution/): Provides an overview of the execution mechanism, including the process of executing transactions and smart contracts.
-   [**Consensus**](./consensus/): Details the consensus mechanism used in the project, such as proof of stake.
-   [**Relay**](./relay/): Explains the inner workings of the relay mechanism.
