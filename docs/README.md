# This folder contains the documentation for the repository.

❕
_The "book" folder within the Contower repository primarily addresses details such as installation, configuration, and operational guidance. In contrast, the "docs" folder offers comprehensive documentation on the project, delving into the functionalities of specific files, their roles, and the rationale behind their selection and use._

This folder contains the documentation for the repository. The documentation is divided into the following sections:

-   [**Rationale**](./rationale/): Provides an overview of the project's purpose, goals, objectives and why certain design decisions were made.
-   [**Repository**](./repo/): Offers an in-depth look at the repository, including its structure, guidelines, and best practices.
-   [**Architecture**](./architecture/): Details the architecture of the execution, consensus, and relay mechanisms.
