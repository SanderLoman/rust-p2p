Contower (derived from "Control Tower") is a versatile and innovative development for the Ethereum network, integrating execution and consensus clients with relay functionalities. This combination allows Contower to serve various roles, from a full node client to a lightweight relay, providing flexibility and efficiency in blockchain operations.

We adhere strictly to the [ethereum/execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/) and [ethereum/consensus-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/) specifications. Our aim is to provide a seamless experience for developers and users, focusing on security, performance, and reliability. Contower is designed to be modular and extensible. We welcome community contributions to help us improve and expand Contower's features.

## What is Contower?

[Contower](https://github.com/nodura/contower) is a versatile and innovative Ethereum client that integrates execution and consensus clients with relay functionalities. It is designed to cater to various user needs, from using it as a full node client to a lightweight relay client, providing flexibility and efficiency in blockchain operations. Additionally, Contower supports all EVM-compatible chains, making it a highly adaptable solution for diverse blockchain environments.

Originally developed by [Nodura](https://github.com/nodura), Contower adheres to the Ethereum specifications for execution and consensus layers, and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.

Contower's relay mechanism significantly enhances node synchronization, allowing nodes to sync faster with the network and enabling immediate chain following upon node startup.

Creating a successful Ethereum client like Contower requires a high-quality implementation that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly, even on consumer hardware. It also involves fostering a strong community of contributors to support and enhance the software continuously.
